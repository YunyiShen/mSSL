Description: Efficient algorithms for fitting regularization paths for several multivariate models with Spike-and-Slab LASSO penalization. Algorithms are chain graph version of Deshpande et al. (2019) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2019.1593179> and spike-and-slab version of Shen and Solis-Lemus (2020) <arxiv:2012.08397>, with time series VAR(1) model. Also probit model for binary and STAR model for integer valued data.
